The dataset comprises of images of male and female. The dataset is divided into a training set and a validation set. 
A Standard Convolution Neural Network is used for this project for now obtaining a training accuracy of 80 percent and validation accuracy of 70 percent. Currently testing the dataset using Transfer Learning and other CNN models such as Resnet and GoogleNet etc.
